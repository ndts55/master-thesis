  abstract   = {Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach shows both student and professional alike the basic concepts of parallel programming and {GPU} architecture. Various techniques for constructing parallel programs are explored in detail. Case studies demonstrate the development process, which begins with computational thinking and ends with effective and efficient parallel programs. Topics of performance, floating-point format, parallel patterns, and dynamic parallelism are covered in depth. For this new edition, the authors are updating their coverage of {CUDA}, including the concept of unified memory, and expanding content in areas such as threads, while still retaining its concise, intuitive, practical approach based on years of road-testing in the authors' own parallel computing courses.--},

  abstract    = {Space mission complexity is constantly increasing, therefore there is a growing demand for highly accurate and fast trajectory design and simulation tools. Some astrodynamics applications, such as planetary protection simulations, require millions of total simulated years to quantify certain probabilities with a high confidence level. It is hoped that by efficient programming, calculations executed in parallel on a {GPU} (Graphics Processing Unit) can bring significant speedups compared to traditional sequential {CPU} (Central Processing Unit) execution, therefore {GPU} utilization for massively parallelized trajectory propagations was investigated. A powerful software was developed in {CUDA} C++ which is able to propagate the trajectories of many samples in parallel on a {CUDA}-capable {GPU}. After an extensive optimization procedure, up to two orders of magnitude speedups were achieved using different test applications compared to single core {CPU} execution of the same software. Numerous test cases were shown to be able to identify which one of them is the most suitable for {GPU} executions. Three examples were presented which intended to show the robustness of the tool when it is applied for real mission cases. The studies included the upper stage disposal of the {BepiColombo} mission, the Lunar Ascent Element disposal of the {HERACLES} mission, and the mirror cover disposal of the {ATHENA} X-ray telescope. Significant speedups were achieved compared to software that are being used by the Mission Analysis Section of the European Space Operations Centre ({ESOC}) for current and future mission designs.},
