Introduction â€“ Why was the study undertaken? What was the research question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the research?
This chapter introduces the evaluation and optimization of the CUDAjectory v2 Performance Architecture.

% TODO: Write an overview of what we are doing and what we hope to achieve
% TODO: Introduce CUDA / MPP - What is it? What does it do?
% TODO: Introduce performance metrics - What are they? What do they tell us about the program? How do we collect them?
% TODO: Introduce performance improvement techniques
% TODO: Introduce CUDAjectory - What does it do and why? How does it do it and why?
% TODO: Compare CUDAjectory performance with Godot performance to explain why CUDAjectory uses CUDA
% TODO: Introduce what we're doing - What are we doing? Why are we doing it? What benefits do we think we'll gain after having done it?
