\chapter{Introduction}
% Brief explanation of what CUDAjectory does
% 	What does CUDAjectory do?
% 		software that is able to propagate the trajectories of many samples in parallel on a CUDA-capable GPU \cite{geda_massive_2019}
% 	initially authored by GEDA as part of a masters thesis at the TU Delft
The design and analysis of satellite orbits forms an integral part of every space project.
This analysis requires fast, high fidelity, and accurate trajectory simulations for multiple samples.
For some astrodynamic applications propagation times can be several thousands or millions of years and often involve large sample sizes.
Running simulations this large on CPUs can take a significant amount of time.
To this end, \citeauthor{geda_massive_2019} developed \cudaj in \citeyear{geda_massive_2019}\cite{geda_massive_2019}.
\cudaj enables fast trajectory simulations of many samples in parallel on CUDA-capable GPUs.
\cudaj was recently rewritten by researchers at the \esoc.
We will refer to the previous version as \cudaj{1} and to the new rewritten version as \cudaj{2}.

% What are we doing?
% 	Analyzing the performance characteristics of the CUDAjectory v2
% 		Pinpoint performance bottlenecks / suboptimal program behavior
% 			By using profiling tools like NSight Compute / Systems
% 		Determine why these performance bottlenecks occur
% 	Improve performance of CUDAjectory v2 by fixing these performance bottlenecks
% 	To this end we start out by introducing CUDA / MPP / performance analysis concepts before analyzing CUDAjectory v2
% 	Then we walk through the changes made to the code and how they impacted performance
% 	Finally, we present how the overall performance compares to the initial codebase
For this work we intend to analyze the performance of \cudaj{2}, pinpoint performance bottlenecks and areas that can be improved.
Then, we improve the program performance, utilizing the information gathered in the analysis.

In the following sections, we will introduce all the necessary concepts of \cuda programming, performance metrics, the tools with which they can be gathered and what they can tell us about a programs performance behavior.
Then, we explore the structure of \cudaj{2} and how it functions.

% TODO write more about the performance analysis once I have written an actual analysis
Using this information we then analyze the performance of \cudaj{2}.
We pinpoint performance bottlenecks and areas where it can be improved.

% TODO write more about improving the performance once I have actually improved the performance
Following the results of the performance analysis, we make changes to the source code and show how those changes impact performance.

Our goal is to improve overall performance by increasing efficient resource usage to enable larger-scale and faster trajectory simulations to aid in the design of space missions.

% What are we hoping to achieve?
% 	Improved performance of CUDAjectory v2 to enable larger-scale and faster trajectory computations
% Why do we want to achieve it?
% 	CUDAjectory already represents a huge improvement in terms of speedup compared to traditional methods which use the CPU (Godot)
% 	CUDAjectory v2 also already surpasses the performance of its predecessor
% 	Our aim is to improve CUDAjectory v2 even further
% 	TODO does this actually answer WHY?

% Introduce CUDA / MPP
% 	What is it?
% 		acronym Compute Unified Device Architecture
% 		CUDA is a general purpose parallel computing platform, providing hardware and software component that allow developers to write and execute highly parallelized applications
% 		general-purpose parallel computing platform
% 		TODO include some figures, use them to explain
% 			software
% 				Kernels
% 					Special functions executed on the device by n threads on n cores
% 					when launching a kernel the dimensions of the grid and the dimensions of all blocks in that grid have to be specified
% 					additionally the size of shared memory per block and the streamId can be specified
% 				Threads
% 					smallest union of execution in a CUDA program
% 					each thread executes a single instance of a kernel function
% 					each thread has access to its own registers
% 					each thread has a unique identifier within a block, given by threadIdx, which is a 3d index
% 				Blocks
% 					a group of threads that can cooperate with each other
% 					threads in a block access the same shared memory and can synchronize their execution
% 					blocks are independent of each other
% 						each block has its own shared memory
% 						each block can be scheduled and executed independently of other blocks
% 					all blocks have the same dimensions
% 						i.e., all threads in a block execute on the same SM
% 					each block has a unique identifier within a grid, given by blockIdx, which is a 3d index
% 				Grids
% 					a collection of blocks
% 					provides the overall structure for organizing blocks
% 				Streams
% 					a queue of GPU operations that are executed in order
% 					multiple streams allow developers to schedule GPU operations concurrently
% 					streams are independent of each other, there is no implicit ordering between GPU operations on different streams
% 			hardware
% 				GPGPU (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit) or more accurately MPP (Massively Parallel Processors)
% 				Unlike traditional CPUs, MPPs posses a larger number of less capable processing units that can execute code in parallel
% 				CUDA Core: the fundamental unit of execution
% 					(executes one instance of a kernel function)
% 					can execute instructions
% 						instructions are issued to multiple cores simultaneously
% 					is also less powerful / capable than a typical modern CPU core
% 					only has little memory to itself (registers)
% 					in return there can be many more CUDA cores in a GPU / an MPP than CPU cores in a CPU
% 					high-end server CPUs can have up to 192 cores
% 						AMD EPYC 9965 has 192 cores https://www.amd.com/de/products/processors/server/epyc/9005-series/amd-epyc-9965.html
% 					high-end server GPUs have (all \cite{elster_nvidia_2022})
% 						144 SMs each with
% 							128 fp32 cores
% 							64 fp64 cores
% 						of course, these GPU cores are less powerful than CPU cores but when correctly programmed the large number of GPU cores can outperform the CPU cores
% 				Streaming Multiprocessors: CUDA cores are contained in Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) \cite{hwu_programming_2023}
% 					an MPP contains multiple SMs
% 						NVIDIA A100 has 108 SMs with 64 cores each \cite{hwu_programming_2023}
% 						NVIDIA H100 has 144 SMs \cite{elster_nvidia_2022}
% 					each SM has on-chip memory
% 						fast but small
% 					each SM has many CUDA cores
% 					also has additional memory
% 						hierarchy from smallest and fastest to largest and slowest
% 						register (file)
% 							r/w per-thread
% 							smallest and fastest
% 						local memory
% 							r/w per-thread
% 							located where shared memory is located
% 							this is where registers spill to
% 						shared memory
% 							r/w per-block
% 					control logic
% 						TODO find out more information about what is meant by "Control"
% 					during execution each block is assigned to one SM
% 						i.e., all threads in a block are assigned to one SM \cite{hwu_programming_2023}
% 					SM groups threads into warps for scheduling and execution
% 				Warps: fundamental unit of scheduling
% 					group of 32 threads within a block that are executed simultaneously
% 					all threads in a wap execute the same instruction in lockstep
% 					(most efficient when all threads in a warp execute the same instruction)
% 				Global Memory
% 					large but slow
